# Introduction

Welcome to the FracTEL Fonestorm API! You can use our API to access Fonestorm API endpoints. Our API is compliant with the [OpenAPI Specification](https://www.openapis.org/). You can view code examples in the right column and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

The Fonestorm API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). We utilize built-in HTTP features, such as HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. [JSON](http://www.json.org/) is returned by all API responses, including errors.
